<p> I enjoy reading the writings of Rabbi Eliyahu of Vilna (1720-1797), known to us as the Vilna Gaon.  The Vilna Gaon comments on many parts of the Torah. He explains the sources for the Shulchan Aruch, interprets Chumash, Neviim, and Aggadot, and he wrote extensively on Kabbalah.  While much of his Torah was written by his students after he passed, we can defitely see a certain style and methodology that charecterizes much of his oeuvre.  The Gaon focuses on the simple - peshat - reading of the text that aligns with the opinion of Chazal. The simple reading - the peshat - parallels many other readings.  It flows naturally with interpretations of drash (homeletical), remez (hints), and sod (Kabbalah).  </p>

<p> I have devoted this site to discussing his writings.  I have focused mostly on his  peshat and halakha insights but also discuss some of his opinions on remez and sod. I have tried to ask questions on these ideas and present answers that align with his  methodology.  </p>

<p> Please feel free to comment and provide your own questions and answers.  I truly believe that Torah is a group effort.  Questioning is part of learning.  There are multiple answers to one question. </p>

<p> I am also happy to post your own ideas on the site, whether they are from the Gaon or another sage that you find inspiring. </p>
